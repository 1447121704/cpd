# cpd

**Coherent Point Drift (CPD)** is a point-set registration algorithm, originally developed by [Andriy Myronenko](https://sites.google.com/site/myronenko/research/cpd) et al.
This is a C++ library that runs CPD.

CPD can be compared to [Iterative Closest Point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterative_closest_point), another point-set registration algorithm that is widely used.
While ICP minimizes point-to-point distances, CPD uses a [Gaussian Mixture Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixture_model) to minimize the error between a point and *all other points*.
If you're thinking that this is very computationally intensive, you're right â€” both the CPD algorithm and the underlying error calculations take a lot of time, which is why we've created [fgt](https://github.com/gadomski/fgt) to speed up those Gauss transforms.
We hope this library provides a freer and more performant alternative to the original reference Matlab implementation.

This library supports three variants of CPD:

- **rigid**: Uses a rigid transformation (i.e. rotation and translation, with an optional scaling) to align the two datasets.
- **nonrigid**: Uses a two-parameter non-rigid transformation function to align the two datasets.
- **affine**: Uses an affine transformation (with an optional scaling) to align the two datasets.

Andriy's reference implementation comes with one other type of registration, **nonrigid_lowrank**, which is not implemented in the latest version of this library (yet) (see [History](#history) for information on how to find and use a previous version of this library that has **nonrigid_lowrank**).

This code lives [on Github](https://github.com/gadomski/cpd).
It has some [Doxygen documentation](http://gadomski.github.io/cpd) and is tested [by Travis](https://travis-ci.org/gadomski/cpd).
We also have a [gitter chatroom](https://gitter.im/gadomski/cpd).

## Usage

**cpd** has a simple functional interface, which accepts [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) matrices and aligns them using some sensible default parameters:

```cpp
#include <cpd/rigid.hpp>

cpd::RigidResult align_with_rigid(const Eigen::MatrixXd& X, const Eigen::MatrixXd& Y) {
    return cpd::rigid(X, Y);
}
```

If you want more control over the parameters, you can use the class-based interface:

```cpp
#include <cpd/rigid.hpp>

cpd::RigidResult align_with_rigid(const Eigen::MatrixXd& X, const Eigen::MatrixXd& Y) {
    cpd::Rigid rigid;
    rigid.allow_scaling(true).no_reflections(false);
    return rigid.compute(X, Y);
}
```

## Installation

**cpd** depends on [fgt](https://github.com/gadomski/fgt) at runtime and [CMake](https://cmake.org/) and Eigen at build-time.

### On OSX

If you're on a Mac, use [homebrew](http://brew.sh/) and [my tap](https://github.com/gadomski/homebrew-gadomski) to install:

```bash
brew tap gadomski/gadomski
brew install cpd
```

### From source

Install fgt (which also requires Eigen) and CMake, then use the usual CMake build incantation for cpd:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

### Using downstream

**cpd** provides CMake export targets that you can import and use in your own project:

```cmake
find_package(Cpd REQUIRED)
add_library(my-great-library
    the_code.cpp
    )
target_link_libraries(my-great-library
    PUBLIC
    Cpd::Library-C++
    )
```

The `Cpd::Library-C++` target includes all the interface settings you need, so you shouldn't need any other calls to get set up.

## OpenMP

Both fgt and Eigen support OpenMP for some operations.
As of yet, the interaction between the two is untested, so our official recommendation is to only use OpenMP with one of the projects, not both.
If you do some work with OpenMP we'd love to hear how it goes.

## Contributing

Github [issues](https://github.com/gadomski/cpd/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/gadomski/cpd/pulls), per usual.

## History

The [v0.1](https://github.com/gadomski/cpd/tree/v0.1) and [v0.2](https://github.com/gadomski/cpd/tree/v0.2) lineages of **cpd** used [armadillo](http://arma.sourceforge.net/) for linear arithmetic instead of Eigen.
Armadillo is a bit smoother for doing advanced eigenvalue decompositions and other operations, which made it a bit easier at first to directly port the Matlab reference implementation.
For a couple of reasons, we decided to switch to Eigen for v0.3.

First, the Armadillo project had the bad habit of removing old versions from their download site, making it hard to maintain working code as their codebase developed.
Second, many downstream applications use Eigen themselves, making Eigen a lower-friction choice for those users.

As of this writing, the Eigen implementation is less feature-full than the old Armadillo implementation, particularly with respect to the nonrigid_lowrank version.
If you require some of that old functionality, use the [v0.2](https://github.com/gadomski/cpd/tree/v0.2) branch.
If you need armadillo-5.x, which is required for the old **cpd** but is no longer available from the armadillo website, you can use [my mirror](https://github.com/gadomski/armadillo).
Thanks for your understanding during this switch.
